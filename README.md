# Enigma
## About
Recreation of the Engima cryptographic machine in python, used by the Third Reich and broken by Polish and British cryptanalysts in the Second World War. This recreation has tried to radically enchance the security of enigma by harnessing modern computing power and removing the flaws of the original machine. Do not use this as an encryption standard.
